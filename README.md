# One Pace NFO

This repo contains NFO files to compliment the [One Pace](https://onepace.net) project.
It does _not_ contain any video files, only metadata.  For poster art, there's zip file
in the #frequently-asked-questions channel on the One Pace Discord, created by the
lovely artists on the One Pace team.  I'm not providing the images here, and instead
deferring to that source.

I'll be honest with y'all, I have no idea how much effort I'll really put into
maintaining this.  I started doing this for myself to make the Kodi experience
a little nicer while watching One Pace, but we'll see how long my motivation
holds.  I'm basically adding new files as I watch the series, so I'm not adding
everything all at once.

Feel free to post issues or PRs if you'd like, hopefully I'll see them and
respond.  If not, by all means feel free to fork this repo; I'm more than happy
to hand the reins to someone that will do a better job maintaining this than I
likely will.

That said, hopefully some people out there find this helpful!  Figured it was
better to share than keep it to myself.
